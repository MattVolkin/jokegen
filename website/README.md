# JokeGen Website Skeleton

This is the frontend skeleton for the JokeGen project.

## Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML file
- `style.css`: Basic styles
- `app.js`: Handles frontend logic and API calls

## Getting Started
Just open `index.html` in your browser to view the static site. For dynamic features, connect to a backend API.

## Features to Implement
- Fetch a random joke from the backend
- Search jokes by keyword
- Play joke audio (if available)

---
This skeleton is intentionally minimal to encourage you to build out the features yourself!
